        <h2>Cross-Site Request Forgery</h2>

        <p>
            Now that you've experimented with CSRF attacks you should have some idea what is possible.
            Now it's time to learn the limitations of CSRF attacks and how to prevent them in your applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Conditions</h3>
        <p>
            CSRF attacks force a browser to perform actions on the user's behalf.
            This means there are some limitations on what this kind of attack can do.
        </p>

            <li>
                <div class="collapsible-header">
                    <i class="material-icons left">vpn_key</i>
                    Side-effects on requests

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>
                        CSRF attacks target state-changing requests. This means they can only target endpoints
                        that make some kind of change, such as changing the victim's email address or password,
                        or purchasing something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The attacker does not recieve the response because it gets sent by the victim's browser.
                        This means CSRF attacks cannot be used to retrieve information.
                        In the example you worked through in this application you learnt how to add and delete
                        entries, but it was not possible to read a user's existing entries.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <i class="material-icons left">open_in_browser</i>
                    Authentication

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>
                        CSRF attack requests have the same authentication as the victim, because they are sent
                        by that person's web browser.
                        This means endpoints are only vulnerable if they do not require any authentication, or
                        the victom is logged in and has access to perform the action.
                    </p>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>
                        CSRF vulnerabilities are much simpler to exploit when they work off GET requests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's worth noting that this behaviour is described
                        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.1">in the HTTP specification</a>.
                        As well as helping to secure your application, you'll be conforming to best practices about
                        HTTP verb usage.

                <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons left">vpn_key</i> Use CSRF tokens for effectful HTTP requests</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>
                        When performing HTTP POSTs (or DELETE, PUT, PATCH etc) that have a side effect, you should
                        include a secure random token in the request (Synchronizer Token pattern).
                        Most web frameworks provide a way to include CSRF tokens out-the-box, you should use these where possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Note:</b> Even if you have some POST/(etc) requests that do not have side-effects it's safer to enable
                        CSRF protection by default for all such requests.
                        This makes it much less likely you'll forget to include the checks on requests that can be exploited.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Note:</b> this approach works best for requests that have a body.
                        If you add tokens to GET or HEAD requests they will appear in the URL.
                        As well as being plainly visible, these are liable to be leaked to proxies, browser caches etc.
                        This is another reason why it's better to restrict side effects to other HTTP methods.
                    </p>

                <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons left">search</i> Origin / Referer header checks</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p>
                        The Origin header was specifically added to the HTTP spec to guard against cross domain attacks.
                        Unfortunately, the header won't always be available so it can't be used as the only of securing your site.
                        By verifying that the Origin matches the site's origin you can be sure the request originated
                        from a genuine user interaction with your application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Referer header may also exist on the request. Similarly, verifying that the referer matches
                        the application helps to ensure it is a legitimate request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In both cases, while it is possible to spoof these headers it isn't possible to do so from a
                        CSRF-style attack unless your site is compromised in another way
                        (e.g. a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability).
